									<h1>About me</h1>
									<p>Aspiring Data Scientist with a background in electronic engineering. Strong analytical and problem-solving abilities honed through rigorous engineering coursework and projects.
										Enthusiastic about leveraging data science to drive innovation and improve decision-making processes. Committed to continuous learning and staying current with industry advancements to effectively contribute to a data-driven organization.</p>

								<p>I was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and quickly moved to Spain at a young age, where I lived until I went to university in London. Throughout my childhood, I always had a strenght in numbers and analytical problem-solving, greately encouraged by my family. This was honed in universtiy, where I studied Electronic Engineering and could leverage my problem-solving skills to solve real-world problems.</p>
								<p>After completing my studies, I moved to Australia, where I fell in love with surfing and developed a great interest in data analysis and visualization. I was interested by the intricacies that a great amount of data can show, and how a skilled individual can discover patterns hidden within. Furthermore, there is the challenge of telling a story with that data to someone that maybe isn't as well versed in Data Science as I am. It was here that I decided that this is the field I wanted to dedicate to. </p>
								<p>In addition to my professional pursuits, I am an avid sports enthusiast, enjoying activities like surfing and playing chess. I also love traveling and exploring new cultures, which continuously broadens my perspective. Music is another passion of mine, providing a creative outlet and a source of inspiration.<\p>
